####Store.js basics:

- `store.set('...', object)` sets the value associated with key '...' to object
- `store.remove('...')` removes the key-value pairing with key '...'
- `store.clear()` clears all key-value pairings from storage
- `store.getAll()` gets all stored values
- `store.forEach(function(...) { ....... })` executes the specified function for
	all stored values

##Storage conventions

Events are stored as javascript objects via store.js.

Events in the D12PEO use the following fields:
- Event id: use as the name of the javascript object
- Event name: what it sounds like
- Date: date of the event (add support for start and end dates?)
- Description: a short description of the event
- Category: used for sorting (on the calendar page, etc.)
- Location...?: NYT gives city and state, but not sure if we want to include this
